## character-extraction

Written from scratch, after my gf explained me how they learn to detect char in her courses

Initially, the aim of this project was to extract chararcters from a document in order to parse them into a text file.
For now, it only extract character as images.

After that, these character images should be put as input into a machine algorithm (NN for example) in order to recognize the characters.
